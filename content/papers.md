**Abstract** \
In this paper, we get into a detailed overview of intra compression dataflow in HEVC and VP9. We describe the common and unique stages of both standards. Then we carry out experiments with JCT-VC HM and WebM VP9 encoders on intra compression efficiency. We also turn some of the HEVC features o to get its data ow as close to VP9 as possible. Finally, we get into a discussion of the efficiency of both codecs, the corresponding standards, and their intra-compression algorithms.

### Iterative Intra Prediction Search for H.265/HEVC
SHARABAYKO M.P., MARKOV N.G.\
2013 International Siberian Conference on Control and Communications (SIBCON), 12-13 Sept. 2013, pp. 1-4. \
Availability: [IEEExplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6693615)

**Abstract**\
In this paper, we propose an iterative intra prediction search for H.265/HEVC encoder to reduce the number of prediction modes for estimation. We base on our research of computational complexity and usage frequency of H.265/HEVC intra prediction. On JCT-VC test sequences, we got about 40% encoding time reduction for HM 10.1 intra-only coding with negligible bitrate increase and PSNR quality degradation. We also offer some additional speed-up techniques, including fast prediction error estimation.
